On Twitter and Slack, I asked:

> If developer's aren't complaining about CI/CD, monitoring/alerting/paging, observability, or feature flags, what other DevOps stuff are they complaining about next?

The exclusions are there because those items seem like clearly (to me!) part of forward-looking DevOps implementations. I recieved lots of interesting answers (unsorted/raw at the moment). Asking questions which elicit interesting answers is fun!

* Security
* Prioritization of the fixes for those
* General toil 
* reliability (e.g., multi-AZs; failovers) 
* reliability-testing (e.g., chaos monkey)
* ease of configuration for infrastructure components
* scalability
* backups and verification of backups
* maintaining a family of applications that share common platform but are all kinda purpose built anyway with enough snowflake configuration that templates aren't very beneficial
* Documentation
* configuration management
* scheduling
* infrastructure management
* secrets management
* service discovery
* load balancing
* analytics
* data stores
* caching
* edge/cdn
* certificate management
* containers container orchestration
* logging 
* cloud cost management
* development tooling & environment
* test environment
* staging environment
* Not understanding what it is you’ve actually built.
* Kubernetes
* All the half assed solutions given to them for the things you just mentioned without actually solving their problems.
* “does anybody know where the installer for ____ is?”
